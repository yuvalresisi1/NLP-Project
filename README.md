# üß¨ DNABERT-2 vs ProteinBERT: Sequence Embedding for Gene and Organism Classification
**Tomer Oron & Yuval Resisi**

This project explores the use of **DNABERT-2** and **ProteinBERT** models to generate embeddings for biological sequences and evaluate their utility in downstream classification, clustering and phylogenetic tasks. The models are compared on their ability to classify:

- The **organism** (full species and genus-level)
- The **gene** from which a sequence originates

We also use the embeddings to construct **phylogenetic trees** that visually reflect relationships between genes and organisms.
